# Attack, Detect & Secure the Environment (AWS)  – Minor & Major Project

## Overview
This repository contains both the **Minor Project** and **Major Project** completed as part of the course requirement. The project focuses on the design, deployment, attack simulation, detection, and security monitoring of a **DMZ-based cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

The project demonstrates:

- Secure network segmentation using DMZ architecture  
- Deployment of EC2 instances in public and private subnets  
- Controlled internet access using Internet Gateway and Route Tables  
- Web server hosting and validation  
- Red Team attack simulations  
- Log analysis using SIEM  
- Security monitoring and hardening  
- Detailed documentation with screenshots

## Project Phases

---

## ✅ Minor Project 

The Minor Project focuses on:

- AWS infrastructure deployment  
- VPC and subnet design (DMZ & Internal)  
- EC2 instance deployment  
- Apache web server setup  
- Documentation and architecture explanation
- 

---

## ✅ Major Project – Attack, Detect & Secure the Environment (AWS)

The Major Project extends the Minor Project by implementing **real-world cloud security operations**. It follows a **Red Team (Attack)** and **Blue Team (Detect & Secure)** approach.

The Major Project includes:

- Red Team SSH attack simulations  
- Generation of real authentication and security logs  
- Log analysis using SIEM (AWS CloudWatch)  
- Identification of misconfigurations  
- Centralized monitoring of system logs  
- Detection of unauthorized access attempts  
- Before vs After security visibility
